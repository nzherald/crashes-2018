The\nstark difference between two public holiday periods just twenty-four\nhours apart strongly suggests that partying and driving is the cause of\nNew Year’s morning’s high crash numbers.\n\nHas there been any change in this behaviour over the last eighteen\nyears?\n\nLooking at the number of fatal, serious injury, minor injury, and\nnon-injury crashes reported each year on New Year’s morning there does\nnot appear to have been any significant change in the number of crashes\nsince 2000."},{"label":"holiday-season","text":"By highlighting all the morning periods on a plot of the total number of\ncrashes that have occurred in every six-hour time period during the last\neighteen Christmas holiday periods, we can see that New Year’s morning\nresults in more of every type of crash than any other morning.\n\nWe can also see that for fatal crashes the only other blocks of time\nthat have been worse than New Year’s morning are the afternoons of the\n27th and 29th of December.\n\nIn general, during the Christmas holiday the time period with most\ncrashes is between noon and 6 pm."},{"label":"summer-fatalities","text":"In New Zealand more car crashes occur per day during late autumn and\nearly winter.

A sobering 8% of Christmas holiday crashes result in a fatality\nor serious injury.\n\nIt isn’t surprising that there are more crashes overall during the\nwetter months, but the fact that there are more fatal and serious injury\ncrashes during summer could be due to either driving behaviour or more\ndriving on smaller roads."}],"outro":[{"label":"outro-one","text":"Below is a timeline showing when every fatal and serious injury crash\nhas occurred during the last eighteen Christmas holiday periods."}]}

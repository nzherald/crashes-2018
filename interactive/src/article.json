{"intro":[{"label":"intro","text":"New Year's morning is the worst morning on New Zealand's roads.\n\nData released to the *New Zealand Herald* by *NZTA* suggests that New\nZealanders are still partying, driving, and then crashing.\n\nSince the start of the year 2000 there have been 444 crashes recorded\nbetween midnight and 6 am on New Year's day. Twelve of these were fatal,\n33 resulted in serious injuries, and 108 caused minor injuries.\n\nThe next worst morning was February 6, with nearly half the number of\ncrashes - 234 in the same time period.\n\nLike New Year's morning, Waitangi Day morning falls on a national\nholiday when many people have been out celebrating and drinking the\nnight before."}],"sections":[{"label":"new-yearâ€™s-morning","text":"On the morning of January 2, only 112 crashes have been recorded --- a\nquarter the number recorded for the same time-period on the first. The\nstark difference between two public holiday periods just twenty-four\nhours apart strongly suggests that partying and driving is the cause of\nNew Year's morning's high crash numbers.\n\nHas there been any change in this behaviour over the last eighteen\nyears?\n\nThere doesn't seem to be. The number of fatal, serious injury, minor\ninjury, and non-injury crashes reported each year on New Year's morning\n--- shown on the right --- doesn't appear to show any significant change\nin the number of crashes since 2000."},{"label":"holiday-season","text":"This highlights all the morning periods for the total number of crashes\nin every six-hour time period during the last eighteen Christmas holiday\nperiods. We can see that New Year's morning results in more of every\ntype of crash than any other morning.\n\nWe can also see that for fatal crashes the only other blocks of time\nthat have been worse than New Year's morning are the afternoons of the\n27th and 29th of December.\n\nIn general, during the Christmas holiday the time period with most\ncrashes is between noon and 6 pm."},{"label":"summer-fatalities","text":"In New Zealand more car crashes occur per day during late autumn and\nearly winter. But more fatal and serious injury crashes occur during\nsummer.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday period 1.5% of crashes are fatal, compared\nto 0.9% during the rest of the year. Over summer 1% are fatal, compared\nto 0.9%, 0.92%, and 0.81% for spring, autumn, and winter respectively."},{"label":"summer-fatalities-and-serious-injuries","text":"For both fatal and serious-injury crashes those seasonal differences are\neven larger --- 7.2% of summer crashes result in a serious injury or\nfatality, while only 5.9% of winter crashes have the same outcome. A\nsobering 8% of Christmas holiday crashes result in a fatality or serious\ninjury.\n\nIt isn't surprising that there are more crashes overall during the\nwetter months, but the fact that there are more fatal and serious injury\ncrashes during summer could be due to either driving behaviour or more\ndriving on smaller roads."}],"outro":[{"label":"outro-one","text":"Below is a timeline showing when every fatal and serious injury crash\nhas occurred during the last eighteen Christmas holiday periods.

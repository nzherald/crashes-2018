This markdown file is passed through a modified markdown parser.
The modified parse will split the markdown into list of labels
and blocks of markdown. The separator between blocks is a horizontal line
and then a level 1 header. 

```
---
# section name
```

Anything (such as this) before the first of these is discarded. 

The text in the section name is slugified and used to indentify
the blocks of markdown so that they can be rendered as used to
trigger a scrolly article.

# intro

After falling for several years New Zealand's road toll has started to rise again.

While our road toll has fallen it remains high by international standards.

# par two

The _New Zealand Herald_ has analysed every hour since that start of 2000 to see
when fatal and serious injury crashes occur.

# New Year's Morning

When each day is split into four six our blocks of time. Almost all 
the periods of time where the most fatal and serious-injury crashes
occur are from six in the evening until Midnight. However, once striking
exception stands out - Midnight until 6 am on the first of January.

# Seasonal trends

When we look at the average number of crashes that occur per day on any given day of
the year the highest number of crashes per day occurs in Autumn.
However, the highest number of fatal and serious-injury crashes per day are occurs in Summer.
So in Summer we are crashing less often, but more of those crashes have severe outcomes.

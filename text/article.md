This markdown file is passed through a modified markdown parser.
The modified parse will split the markdown into list of labels
and blocks of markdown. The separator between blocks is a horizontal line
and then a level 1 header.

# section name

Anything (such as this) before the first of these is discarded. 

The text in the section name is slugified and used to indentify
the blocks of markdown so that they can be rendered as used to
trigger a scrolly article.

# intro


New Year's morning is the worst morning on New Zealand's roads.

Data released to the _New Zealand Herald_ by _NZTA_ suggests that New Zealanders are still partying, driving, and then crashing.

Since the start of the year 2000 There have been 444 crashes recorded between
midnight and 6 am on New Year's day. 12 of these were fatal, 33 resulted in serious injuries, and 108 in minor injuries.

The next worst morning was February 6, with nearly half the number of crashes.234 crashes were recorded in the same time period.

The combination of New Year's morning and Waitangi Day morning as the two worst mornings on our roads suggests that New Zealander's are not managing their partying and transport safely.

# New Year's Morning

On the morning of January 2, only 112 crashes have been recorded &mdash; a quarter the number recorded for the same time-period on the first. The stark difference between two public holiday periods just twenty-four hours apart strongly suggests that partying and driving is the cause of New Year's morning's high crash numbers.

Has there been any change in this behaviour over the last eighteen years? 

Looking at the number of fatal, serious injury, minor injury, and non-injury
crashes reported each year on New Year's morning there does not appear to have been any significant change in the number of crashes since 2000.

# Holiday Season

When we look at the average number of crashes that occur per day on any given day of
the year the highest number of crashes per day occurs in Autumn.
However, the highest number of fatal and serious-injury crashes per day are occurs in Summer.
So in Summer we are crashing less often, but more of those crashes have severe outcomes.

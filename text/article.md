This markdown file is passed through a modified markdown parser.
The modified parse will split the markdown into list of labels
and blocks of markdown. The separator between blocks is a horizontal line
and then a level 1 header.

Anything (such as this) before the first of these is discarded. 

The text in the section name is slugified and used to indentify
the blocks of markdown so that they can be rendered as used to

# intro


New Year's morning is the worst morning on New Zealand's roads.

Data released to the _New Zealand Herald_ by _NZTA_ suggests that New Zealanders are still partying, driving, and then crashing.

Since the start of the year 2000 there have been 444 crashes recorded between
midnight and 6 am on New Year's day. 12 of these were fatal, 33 resulted in serious injuries, and 108 caused minor injuries.

The next worst morning was February 6, with nearly half the number of crashes.234 crashes were recorded in the same time period.

The combination of New Year's morning and Waitangi Day morning as the two worst mornings on our roads suggests that New Zealander's are not managing their partying and transport safely.

# New Year's Morning

On the morning of January 2, only 112 crashes have been recorded &mdash; a quarter the number recorded for the same time-period on the first. The stark difference between two public holiday periods just twenty-four hours apart strongly suggests that partying and driving is the cause of New Year's morning's high crash numbers.

Has there been any change in this behaviour over the last eighteen years? 

Looking at the number of fatal, serious injury, minor injury, and non-injury
crashes reported each year on New Year's morning there does not appear to have been any significant change in the number of crashes since 2000.

# Holiday Season

By highlighting all the morning periods on a plot of the total number of crashes that have occurred in every six-hour time period during the last eighteen Christmas holiday periods, we can see that New Year's morning results in more of every type of crash than any other morning.

We can also see that for fatal crashes the only other blocks of time that have been worse than New Year's morning are the afternoons of the 27th and 29th of December.

In general, during the Christmas holiday the time period with most crashes is  between noon and 6 pm.

# Summer fatalities

In New Zealand more car crashes occur per day during late autumn and early winter. But more fatal and serious injury crashes occur during summer.

1.5% of crashes during the Christmas holiday period are fatal, while only 0.9% of crashes during the rest of the year are fatal. More broadly 1% of summer are fatal. The fatal percentage of crashes in spring, autumn, and winter is 0.9%, 0.92%, and 0.81%.

# Summer fatalities & serious injury

When considering both fatal and serious-injury crashes that seasonal differences are even larger, 7.2% of summer crashes result in a serious injury or fatality, while only 5.9% of winter crashes have the same outcome. A sobering 8% of Christmas holiday crashes result in a fatality or serious injury.

It isn't surprising that there are more crashes overall during the wetter months, but the fact that there are more fatal and serious injury crashes during  summer could be due to either driving behaviour or more driving on smaller roads.

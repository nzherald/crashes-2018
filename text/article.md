This markdown file is passed through a modified markdown parser.
The modified parse will split the markdown into list of labels
and blocks of markdown. The separator between blocks is a horizontal line
and then a level 1 header. 

```
---
# section name
```

Anything (such as this) before the first of these is discarded. 

The text in the section name is slugified and used to indentify
the blocks of markdown so that they can be rendered as used to
trigger a scrolly article.

# intro


New Years morning is the worst morning on New Zealand's roads.

Data released
to the _New Zealand Herald_ by _NZTA_ suggests that New Zealanders are still
partying, driving, and then crashing.

Since the start of the year 2000
There have been 444 crashes recorded between midnight and 6 am
in New Years day. 12 of these were fatal, 33 resulted in serious injuries, and 108
in minor injuries.

The next worst morning is February 6th, when only 234 crashes 
were recorded in the same time period.

The combination of New Years morning and Waitangi Day morning as the two worst
mornings on our roads suggests that New Zealander's are not managing their
partying and transport safely.

# New Year's Morning

When each day is split into four six our blocks of time. Almost all 
the periods of time where the most fatal and serious-injury crashes
occur are from six in the evening until Midnight. However, once striking
exception stands out - Midnight until 6 am on the first of January.

# Seasonal trends

When we look at the average number of crashes that occur per day on any given day of
the year the highest number of crashes per day occurs in Autumn.
However, the highest number of fatal and serious-injury crashes per day are occurs in Summer.
So in Summer we are crashing less often, but more of those crashes have severe outcomes.
